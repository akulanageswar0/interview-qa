Scrum is a framework for agile project management that emphasizes collaboration, iterative development, and continuous improvement. It is used for software development, but can be applied to other types of projects as well.

# SCRUM:

* In Scrum, the development process is broken down into a series of iterations called "sprints." Each sprint typically lasts two to four weeks and involves a cross-functional team of developers, product owners, and other stakeholders. The team meets daily for a "stand-up" meeting to discuss progress and identify any obstacles that need to be addressed.

* The product owner is responsible for defining the project's requirements and priorities, and the development team works together to build and deliver working software in each sprint. At the end of each sprint, the team holds a "sprint review" meeting to demonstrate the completed work and receive feedback from stakeholders.

* Scrum also includes a retrospective process at the end of each sprint, where the team reflects on what went well and what could be improved for the next sprint. This focus on continuous improvement and collaboration is what makes Scrum an effective framework for agile project management.
