Prometheus and Grafana are two popular open-source tools commonly used in the field of monitoring and observability.

Prometheus is a powerful time-series database and monitoring system that is designed to collect and store metrics from various sources such as applications, servers, and databases. It uses a pull-based model to collect data from different sources, and it can monitor a wide range of metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, network activity, and more. Prometheus also provides a powerful query language called PromQL, which enables users to retrieve and analyze data from the time-series database.

On the other hand, Grafana is a popular visualization tool that is commonly used with Prometheus. It allows users to create interactive and customizable dashboards that display real-time metrics and data from various sources. Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including Prometheus, and it provides a rich set of visualization options such as graphs, tables, and heatmaps.

Together, Prometheus and Grafana offer a powerful solution for monitoring and visualizing data from various sources in real-time. They are widely used in the industry, particularly in the fields of DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), to help teams identify and troubleshoot issues quickly and efficiently.

Prometheus and Grafana are two open-source tools used to monitor and visualize data from different sources such as servers and applications. Prometheus collects and stores the data, while Grafana displays the data in customizable dashboards. It help teams quickly identify and solve issues by providing real-time insights into system performance.
