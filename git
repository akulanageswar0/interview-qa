The git rebase command is used to apply changes from one branch to another, typically used to integrate changes from a feature branch into a main branch. Here's an example use case for git rebase:

Suppose you are working on a feature branch feature-branch that was branched off the main branch a few weeks ago. Meanwhile, several changes have been made to the main branch that you want to incorporate into your feature-branch. You could merge the main branch into feature-branch, but this would create an unnecessary merge commit that clutters the commit history. Instead, you can use git rebase to apply the changes from main directly onto your feature-branch.

Here are the steps to do this:

Checkout the main branch and pull any changes that have been made since you branched off feature-branch:

git checkout main
git pull
Checkout the feature-branch:

git checkout feature-branch
Use git rebase to apply the changes from main onto feature-branch:

git rebase main
This will apply the changes from main onto feature-branch, one by one, and prompt you to resolve any conflicts that may arise.

Push the updated feature-branch to the remote repository:

git push --force origin feature-branch
Note that using --force is necessary because the commit history of feature-branch has been rewritten.

By using git rebase instead of git merge, you keep a clean and linear commit history, which makes it easier to understand the evolution of your codebase.
