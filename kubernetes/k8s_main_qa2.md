Kubernetes (k8s) supports several types of deployments, each with its own unique characteristics and use cases. Some of the most common types of k8s deployments are:

<em>
ReplicaSet: ReplicaSet is the basic building block of Kubernetes. It is responsible for maintaining a set of identical pods running at the same time.

Deployment: A Deployment is a higher-level abstraction that builds on top of the ReplicaSet. It provides additional functionality such as rolling updates, scaling, and rollback capabilities.

StatefulSet: A StatefulSet is used for stateful applications that require stable network identities, persistent storage, and ordered scaling.

DaemonSet: A DaemonSet ensures that a specific pod is running on each node in the cluster. This is useful for tasks such as log collection, monitoring, and other system-level tasks.

Job: A Job is used for batch processing tasks, where a certain number of pods run to completion and then exit.

CronJob: A CronJob is similar to a Job, but it runs on a predefined schedule. This is useful for running periodic tasks, such as backups or cleanup jobs.

Each of these k8s deployments is designed to handle specific use cases, and choosing the right one depends on the requirements of your application.
