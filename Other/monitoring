Prometheus and Grafana are two popular open-source tools commonly used in the monitoring and visualization of systems and applications. While both tools are often used together, they serve different functions.

Prometheus is a monitoring system and time-series database. It collects metrics from various sources, such as servers, applications, and containers, and stores them in a time-series database. Prometheus supports various data sources and provides a powerful query language to analyze and visualize the collected data. It also provides alerting capabilities to notify users when certain conditions are met.

Grafana, on the other hand, is a visualization and analytics tool used to create interactive dashboards and graphs. It connects to data sources, including Prometheus, to fetch and visualize the collected data. Grafana allows users to create custom dashboards with various types of graphs, tables, and panels to visualize metrics and monitor system performance. Grafana also provides alerting features to notify users when metrics cross predefined thresholds.

In summary, Prometheus is a monitoring tool that collects and stores metrics, while Grafana is a visualization tool that fetches and displays the collected data in a visually appealing way. Together, they provide a powerful and flexible solution for monitoring and visualizing system performance.
