Migration of pipelines from free styel jobs to pipelines jobs
adding multiple stages to the existing pipelines
Upgradation Jenkins, Install and Configure plugins
Adopting and Implementing best pratices in Jenkins
   Clearing old build logs
   timeout
   shared library
   
Monitoring Tasks:
Implementing monitoring of applications and clusters
Admin activities in prometheus and grafana
  adding data source in grafana
  adding new targets, customer rules and alerts in prometheus

====================================================
Containerization tasks:
Migration of applications from vM based deployments to containers

Call Meeting with DEV Team to collect requirements
     
    Application Environment
	Configs
	Env variables
	command build and start
	ports
	test the applicaiton (command)
	health check
	

Understanding application, writing dockerfiles and deploying dockerized applicaiton on kubernetes.
Creating Helm charts(writing multiple kubernetes manifest files like deployment, service,hpa, configmaps and ingress
Deploying application manually on k8s cluster and teting the application with few test cases

Once application is working fine we start creating pipelines to deploy application on k8s cluster.
docker image creation, image scanning, push to repository and deploying to k8s and monitor
  5xx, 4xx
  Success rate
  latency
  Resource utilization(memory and cpu)
  restart
  other applicaiton errors
  

Prepare helm charts for higher environments like dev,uat and prod
Handover calls
educate dev teams
support dev teams in deployments and issue


Admins tasks:
Creating namespaces
changing resource quota
adding users to namespaces on request basis

Kuberenetes Issues:
Out of memory
deployment issues(image, service stop etc,)
probes (readiness, livesprobes and startupprobes)
readiness out of rotation issue, port forwarding can be used to for testing the issue
config issues(timeout and paths issues)(while using configmap, subpath need to be used)
Permission issues, copy to temp and move to different dir
Container should not be used with root users
ephemeral containers


===========================================
Ansible:
automating installation and configuration of php/python appllication servers
Ansible

Architecture: Push mechanism
Advantages of ansible:
1.agentless
2.no need to install nodes on remote servers
3. totally relies on SSH
4. Apple, NASA, JUNIPER uses ansible

Diff b/w ansible and other config tool
1.puppet and chef uses ruby-DSL but ansible uses YAML(python)
2. ansible uses push mechanism where as puppet,chef uses pull mechanism
